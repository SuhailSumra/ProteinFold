# ProteinFold

ProteinFold is a replication of AlphaFold2 which perfoms predictions of Protein Structure.

### Tech Stack 

ProteinFold will be developed using the following stack:

- Python (Version 3.5+)
- Tensorflow-GPU
- Pytorch GPU

### Todos

- [ ] Well, First Understand How AlphaFold Works
- [ ] Understand Protein Folding Process
- [ ] Come Up With An Architecture For The Whole Process
- [ ] Use Of Relevant Protein Folding Databases
- [ ] Play With Existing Models
- [ ] Implement a Different Model
- [ ] Maybe Start blogging about this whole process who knows :)
