# ProteinFold

ProteinFold is a replication of AlphaFold2 which perfoms predictions of Protein Structure.

### Tech Stack 

ProteinFold will be developed using the following stack:

- Python (Version 3.5+)
- Tensorflow-GPU
- Pytorch GPU

### Todos

- [ ] Well, First Understand How AlphaFold Works
- [ ] Understand Protein Folding Process
- [ ] Implement a 2D Resnet For Distance Prediction
- [ ] Implement a 1D Resnet For Angle Prediction


### Contribution
I would love to recieve Contributions From The Invitees!! :)

#### Hope You All Stay Safe And Make Something Useful Out Of Your Quarantine Session.
